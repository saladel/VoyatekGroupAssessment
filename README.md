Use the provided Figma design to create the UI.
Ensure the UI matches the design specifications closely.
Pay attention to details like spacing, fonts, colors, and alignment.
Make the UI responsive for different screen sizes.

#### Integration:
Integrate the UI with the API.
Implement the necessary logic to send trip details to the API and handle the response.
Provide feedback to the user on the success or failure of the trip creation.

## Architecture and Tools Used
- The application is built using Swift and SwiftUI.
- I made use of Async/Await for the GET request, URLSession for the POST request.
- I used the Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) architecture.

 by removing the `//` in front of it.
 
- Also Go to `ViewModel -> TripDetailViewModel` comment
 ```swift
let endpoint = "https://tripps.free.beeceptor.com/my-trip"
